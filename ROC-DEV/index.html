                ROC-DEV is a project me and a team of 5 people developed for 6 weeks for school. <br>
                the ROC-DEV project was to make a secure planning page for the school. <br>
                The project was made using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL. <br>
                I was responsible for the front end of the login page and some of the back end, 
                along with multiple functions such as password reset through email. <br>
                me and my team went through alot of trouble, but we managed to get the project done, and learned alot of new things along the way. <br>
